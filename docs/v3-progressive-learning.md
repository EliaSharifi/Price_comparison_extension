# V3 – Progressive Feature Iteration

**Goal:** Make the extension smarter step-by-step.

**How I progressed:**
1. Started with raw price extraction from one site.
2. Added a second site (Coles) and cross-comparison.
3. Introduced Claude for fuzzy matching of product names.
4. Iteratively refined prompts and logic based on real-world testing.
5. Used Cursor to safely refactor multiple files while AI helped reason over the code.

**Key takeaway:** Small, iterative steps made the AI feature reliable and understandable.
