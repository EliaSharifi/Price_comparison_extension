# V0 – Woolworths Price Extraction

**Goal:** Build a minimal Chrome extension that can extract the product price from Woolworths.

**What I learned:**
- Chrome content scripts
- Querying real-world DOMs
- Messaging between popup and content script

**Challenges:**
- Dealing with dynamic selectors
- Fallbacks for missing DOM elements
